# SIMPLE DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION USING C

Welcome to the C Memory Allocation Project! This project demonstrates a simple memory allocation system in C using a linked list. It allows for the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks with unique names and displays the details of allocated memory blocks.

## Introduction
This C Memory Allocation Project provides a basic understanding of memory allocation using a linked list structure. It includes functionality to allocate and deallocate memory blocks, display the details of allocated memory blocks, and more.

## Features
- Allocate memory blocks with unique names.
- Deallocate memory blocks by specifying the block name.
- Display details of allocated memory blocks.
- Prevents repeated names for memory blocks.

## Usage
1. Allocation of Memory Block
   - Run the program.
   - Choose option 1 to allocate memory.
   - Enter the size of the block to be allocated.

2. Deallocation of Memory Block
   - Choose option 2 to deallocate a memory block.
   - Enter the name of the block to be deallocated.

3. Display Allocated Memory Blocks
   - Choose option 3 to display all allocated memory blocks.

4. Exit
   - Choose option 4 to exit the program.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Code:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
   - Compile the code:
     ```bash
     gcc filename.c -o program_name
     ```

2. Run the Program:
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./program_name
     ```

   Replace `filename.c` with the actual filename of your C code, and `program_name` with the desired name for the compiled program.
